This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Concept

In this Project, I use `Atomic Design Methodology` for maintain component foldering system, `Context API` for maintain state management, and `App Router` to maintain route management. Besides that, I seperate file and folder based on functionality.

## Note

- For mocking auth and user data, I use [Dummyjson Auth](https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth#auth-login). You can see https://dummyjson.com/users for list users are posible to use to login in this project.
- All data stored in localstorage.

## Access

You can access the test at https://nomina-test.vercel.app/.
